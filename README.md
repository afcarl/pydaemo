## Getting started with PyDaemo.
The first step to use the API is to download your credentials so that you have permissions to communicate with Daemo. Download the access tokens as a JSON file by navigating to your Daemo Profile and clicking "Get Credentials" under the menu in your profile.

Ensure that the credentials you obtain contain a `client_id`, `access_token` and `refresh_token`. Create and save your credentials in `credentials.json` file. Let's explore the API with two use cases. In the first example below, we will use PyDaemo to create, launch and collect surveys filled in by crowd workers.

### Let's create a simple survey project.
Coming soon.


### Let's get more advanced and create a
